# decycler

This code implements the decycling and dismantling procedures devoloped in 

Braunstein, Alfredo, Luca Dall'Asta, Guilhem Semerjian, and Lenka Zdeborov√°. "Network Dismantling." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, October 18, 2016, 201605083. doi:10.1073/pnas.1605083113, arxiv:1603.08883.

Compilation:
===========

You'll need the boost libraries. To compile the multi-threading version, 
you need an openmp-compliant C++ compiler (e.g. g++). In that case just uncomment the 
corresponding OMP line in the Makefile. 
Adjust Makefile as needed and issue 'make'




How to test:
============

RANDOM GRAPH
--------

    # generate an N=78125, <k>=1.5 graph as in the paper

    python gnp.py 78125 3.5 1 > graph.txt

    # find a decycling set (use ./decycler to adjust parameters. If you have OMP working -jn would run in n threads)

    ./decycler -o < graph.txt > seeds.txt

    # break the decycled graph into components of size <= 100

    cat graph.txt seeds.txt  | python treebreaker.py 100 > broken.txt

    # reintroduce removed nodes as long as component are of size <= 200

    cat graph.txt seeds.txt broken.txt | ./reverse-greedy -t 200 > output.txt

    # the resulting seed set should be in output.txt in the format:

    S i


TWITTER NETWORK
----------

    # again, use -jn to run with n threads if you have OMP

    zcat twitter.txt.gz | ./decycler -o > seeds-twitter.txt

    (zcat twitter.txt.gz; cat seeds-twitter.txt) | python treebreaker.py 100 > broken-twitter.txt

    (zcat twitter.txt.gz; cat seeds-twitter.txt broken-twitter.txt ) | ./reverse-greedy -t 100000 > output-twitter.txt
